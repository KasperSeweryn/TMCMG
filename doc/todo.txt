- Postprocess functions to make liquids (and maybe sand and gravel) not be in
  unrealistic positions
- Large, branching trees
- Flower/mushroom populator
- 'center on player' button in Export Chunks window

* Write FUSE filesystem to automatically generate chunks.
* Fix race conditions so GenFSServer works
  * Fix trying to generate a chunk multiple times simultaneously
  * Don't use a TNLCompiler from multiple threads
* Tree populator should have some reasonable limit (like 1 tree per 4
  square meters) on density
* Pine trees
* Add hint bar in Chunk Exporter window showing the player's coordinates,
  if they are found in level.dat.
* Show script errors in WorldDesigner UI
* Make MPP display not flash so much, maybe move it to that status bar at the bottom
  - mouvred to share status bar with script errors 
* Better documentation!
  - There's a README with some lengthy explanations of thins, now.
