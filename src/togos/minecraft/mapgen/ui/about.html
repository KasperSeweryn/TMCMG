<h1>TOGoS's Minecraft Map Generator</h1>

<p>...generates Minecraft Chunk data based on a TOGoS Noise Language (TNL)
file containing parameters for the terrain, including heights of different types
of ground and tree/vegetation distribution.  See the example script for
explanations of script components.</p>

<h3>Coordinates</h3>

<p>Map coordinates are given as X, Y, and Z.  If you like to think that the
in-game sun sets in the West, then +X = South, and +Z = West.  Y goes from 0
(bedrock) to 128 (top of highest hill).  Coordinates are usually in meters,
though when talking about chunk coordinates, they are usually in numbers of
chunks (16 meters on a side).</p>

<h3>World Preview</h3>

<p>This window shows side and top views of the terrain resulting from interpreting the loaded
script.  You can move around using the arrow keys and zoom in and out using plus
and minus.  For now this shows only base terrain--no chunk-based objects
such as trees or grass will appear in the preview.
The number next to "MPP" near tht bottom indicates Meters Per Pixel.</p>

<h3>Export Chunks</h3>

<p>This window pops up when you select Export Chunks under the File menu.  To select
an output directory (this should be a directory directly under <code>saves/</code> for SP
data), you must browse to that directory and select a file directly within that
directory, such as <code>level.dat</code>.</p>

<p>The 4 boxes under the output directory selection are to give the
X and Z coordinates of the northeastern-most corner and the width and
height of the area to generate.  X, Z, width, and depth are all in terms
of chunks, which are 16 blocks (16 meters) on a side.
When you hit <i>Generate</i> it will start generating new data
for those chunks and writing them into the chosen output directory.
<font color="red">WARNING:</font> THIS WILL OVERWRITE ANY EXISTING TERRAIN/BUILDINGS/OBJECTS
IN THE AREA, so either back up your data before generating, or only generate
on maps that have nothing you want to keep.</p>
