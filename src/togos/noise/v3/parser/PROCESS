- Character list
- Token list
- Syntax tree
- Alias + function application tree (symbols not yet validated)
- Function application tree (constant symbols replaced with their value, parameter symbols validated) 
- Optimized function application tree (constants folded)

The function application tree can then be evaluated or compiled.

To compile a function to a vector program:
- inline all function calls
- if any cannot be inlined, it cannot be compiled!
- recursively write instructions to calculate the result of each
  expression, caching the result variable of each and re-using
  for identical expressions
